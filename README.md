# What is this?
Tumbling Tectonics is a video game inspired by Temple Run, where you run up a never-ending slope and have to collect as many coins as you can. However there is one problem, or rather, many problems: there are boulders falling down towards you! How many points can you get, how many boulders can you dodge, before they become too much? Can you handle the tumbling tectonics?

# How did I make it?
This game was created in Unity game engine for the SIUE CS382 course, a game design & development course. It was designed based on my experience playing video games all my life, and implemented based on a combination of my previous experience creating video games in CS382 and my extensive programming experience over the years. It uses many custom Unity assets, animations, and sounds found on various sources online such as the Unity Asset Store, Mixamo, and YouTube. I was able to put this game on the internet through WebGL, so you can play it without even cloning the repo. This also allowed for me to easily playtest this game and get nice feedback about it, including some very good ideas for future additions which may be implemented in the future.

# How to clone the repo?
Just git clone the repo, it should simply install everything you need and give you the same version of the game in the Unity Hub. The only possibly difficult roadblock that you may encounter was that I used Git LFS to handle some large files due to Git's 100MB file size limit, so you may struggle when committing again if you choose to fork this repo or something. It's not really a problem, it's just something anyone who clones the repo should be aware of and know how to handle correctly.
